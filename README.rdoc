## Usage
Just drop this into your config/initializers directory and you're ready to go.

Works on most file objects without error however this is untested.

f = File.open("bunnys-forever.jpg")

f.info #=> Hash, path, name, format, width, height, size

attributes are accessible by using f.width or f.format
